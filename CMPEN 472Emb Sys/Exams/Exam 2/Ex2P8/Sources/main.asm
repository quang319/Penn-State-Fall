;* Program: Output character string to SCI port, print message
;* Input:   Register X points to ASCII characters in memory
;* Output:  message printed on the terminal connected to SCI port
;* 
;* Registers modified: CCR
;* Algorithm:
;     Pick up 1 byte from memory where X register is pointing
;     Send it out to SCI port
;     Update X register to point to the next byte
;     Repeat until the byte data $00 is encountered
